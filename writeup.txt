===================================

We have Tomcat running on port 8080 and that is the only port that nmap found. I'm running a full port scan on nmap using -p- just in case I missed something but for now I'm going to search exploitdb and see if we can attack this with an exploit or metasploit.

The full port scan did not pick up anythin extra. So we will be attacking through 8080.

Found a successful login with tomcat:s3cret

Using the multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload I was able to get a meterpreter shell onto the system. Now to find the user and root flag.

The flags were both in the same textfile on the administrator desktop

This was a really easy box if you know how to use metasploit. I think it's a really good box to have on the beginner track.
